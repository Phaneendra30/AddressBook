As part of my practice during training at Emerxe Information Technology, I developed a console-based Address Book project using the C language, with a focus on strengthening my embedded systems programming skills.

🔧 Features implemented:

Add new contacts

View all contacts

Search contacts by name or number

Edit existing contacts

Delete contacts

File-based storage for data persistence

💡 What I learned:

Hands-on experience with file handling in C

Better understanding of structures, pointers, and memory management

Improved logic-building and user input handling

Reinforced core C skills essential for embedded systems development

👨‍💻 This project gave me practical insights into managing data efficiently—something very relevant to embedded system design and real-time application
